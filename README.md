# Project - README

This is the [Final Project] for [CSE 20289 Systems Programming (Spring 2020)].

A webserver in C as well as a web client (thor.py).  The server is forking and can handle multiple requests.  The client can repeatedly hammer a server with requests. 

## Summary of code:
/bin/ contains the client (thor.py) as well as shell scripts that use the client to test the server's latency and throughput. The shell scripts test_spidey.sh and test_thor.sh were written and provided by our instructor for grading purposes

/src/ contains all the files used for the server itself.  No instructor provided files are in /src/.
